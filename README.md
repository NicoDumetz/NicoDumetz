# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm **Nicolas Dumetz**, a developer passionate about **artificial intelligence** and **firmware programming**. I’ve been fascinated by how machines think and interact with the world ever since I got my first PC back in middle school.

Currently based in **Lille** and studying at **Epitech**, I’m always exploring the frontier between low-level systems and high-level intelligence.
